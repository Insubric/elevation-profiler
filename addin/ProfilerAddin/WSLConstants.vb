    ' Elevation profiler is a GIS tool that automatically calculate transverse or longitudinal elevation profiles starting from a shapefile of points and a digital elevation model (DEM)
    ' The tool il conceived as a VBA macro (composed by a form and 5 modules) that can be added and run from the visual basic editor in ArcMap
