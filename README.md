Short-definition

**Elevation profiler** is a GIS tool designed to work with ArcGIS that automatically calculates transverse or longitudinal elevation profiles of different lengths starting from a shapefile of points (representing the midpoints of the profile segments) and a digital elevation model (e.g. high resolution Lidar DEM). The calculated profiles are then saved in comma-separated tabular data files (.csv).
